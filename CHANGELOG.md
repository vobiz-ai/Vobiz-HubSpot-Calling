# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-20

First public release.

### Added

- Outbound calling with browser audio over WebRTC.
- Inbound calling with an Accept / Decline prompt.
- Call logging to HubSpot, with duration and outcome.
- Recording playback behind an HMAC-signed, short-expiry link that carries no
  credentials.
- Setup, architecture and troubleshooting documentation.

### Notes

- The browser is the A leg: the panel sends the SIP INVITE and the backend
  answers `<Dial><Number>`. Originating to the customer over REST and bridging
  the agent in with `<Dial><User>` does not work — routing into a registered
  WebRTC endpoint is blocked platform-side. Inbound is the exception.
- Single-account by design in this release. See the known limitations in the
  README before deploying for more than one agent.
